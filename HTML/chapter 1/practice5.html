    BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan; lit. Bulletproof Boy Scouts), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South
    Korean boy band formed in 2010. The band consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook, who co-write or
    co-produce much of their material. Originally a hip hop group, they expanded their musical style to incorporate a
    wide range of genres, while their lyrics have focused on subjects including mental health, the troubles of
    school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, individualism, and the consequences of fame
    and recognition. Their discography and adjacent work has also referenced literature, philosophy and psychology, and
    includes an alternate universe storyline.

    BTS debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment with the single album 2 Cool 4 Skool. BTS released their first
    Korean and Japanese-language studio albums, Dark & Wild and Wake Up respectively, in 2014. The group's second Korean
    studio album, Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS had crossed into
    the global music market and led the Korean Wave into the United States, becoming the first Korean ensemble to
    receive a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single "Mic Drop",
    as well as the first act from South Korea to top the Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear
    (2018). In 2020, BTS became the fastest group since the Beatles to chart four US number-one albums in less than two
    years, with Love Yourself: Answer (2018) becoming the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA; in the same
    year, they also became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 and
    Billboard Global 200 with their Grammy-nominated single "Dynamite". Follow-up releases "Savage Love", "Life Goes
    On", "Butter", and "Permission to Dance" made them the fastest act to earn four US number-one singles since Justin
    Timberlake in 2006.

    As of 2023, BTS is the best-selling musical act in South Korean history according to the Circle Chart, having sold
    in excess of 40 million albums.[2] Their studio album Map of the Soul: 7 (2020) is the fourth best-selling album of
    all time in South Korea, as well as the first in the country to surpass both four and five million registered sales.
    They are the first non-English-speaking and Asian act to sell out concerts at Wembley Stadium and the Rose Bowl
    (Love Yourself World Tour, 2019), and were named the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry's (IFPI)
    Global Recording Artist of the Year for both 2020 and 2021. The group's accolades include multiple American Music
    Awards, Billboard Music Awards, Golden Disc Awards, and nominations for five Grammy Awards. Outside of music, they
    have addressed three sessions of the United Nations General Assembly and partnered with UNICEF in 2017 to establish
    the Love Myself anti-violence campaign. Featured on Time's international cover as "Next Generation Leaders" and
    dubbed the "Princes of Pop", BTS has also appeared on Time's lists of the 25 most influential people on the internet
    (2017–2019) and the 100 most influential people in the world (2019), and in 2018 became the youngest recipients of
    the South Korean Order of Cultural Merit for their contributions in spreading the Korean culture and language.
